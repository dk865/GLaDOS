# GLaD*OS*
### A Very Minimal Linux Distribution inspired by Aperture Science's *Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System*, or *GLaDOS* for short. 

Made possible by [TornadoCookieâ€™s Aperture Science Terminal Remake](https://github.com/TornadoCookie/glados), and a generous grant from *Aperture Laboratories*

## Installation
Because of the very minimal size, I would recommend using a Ventoy Flash Drive. Setup is easy, just visit the [Official Ventoy Page](https://www.ventoy.net/en/), navigate to [Downloads](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html), and select your Operating System.
After you create the drive, download the latest ISO file from the releases page. Simply copy the file over the the drive named "Ventoy" (not VTOYEFI) and boot from it.

NOTE: You may need to diable Secure Boot if your computer supports it. If not, then follow a guide on how to enroll the Machine Owner's Key (.mok) files from the VTOYEFI drive, and the one for the ISO file I generated, also to be found in the releases page.

If the previous is too difficult, or you don't have a flash drive handy, a Virtual Machine is your next best bet.
Simply install [Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), whichever you prefer, and find a guide online on how to boot from an ISO using either- it's rather simple, but it's best to leave this tutorial short.

If you encounter issues, please don't hesitate to leave an issue- I am always happy to help (:
